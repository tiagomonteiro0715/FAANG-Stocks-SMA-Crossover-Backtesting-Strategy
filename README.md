## Project Overview
This Python script implements a backtesting strategy for FAANG stocks (AAPL, META, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) using a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover** technique. The objective is to simulate the performance of a trading strategy over a historical time period and evaluate its results.

### Key Components
1. **Libraries and Data Sources:**
   - `vectorbt`: A vectorized backtesting framework.
   - `yfinance`: Used to download historical stock data.
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation and storage.

2. **Strategy Overview:**
   - The script calculates two moving averages for each stock: a short-term (50-day) and a long-term (200-day) average.
   - A **buy signal** is generated when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA (bullish crossover).
   - A **sell signal** is generated when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA (bearish crossover).

3. **Portfolio Setup:**
   - The initial total portfolio value is set to **$1,000,000**.
   - This amount is **equally distributed** across the 5 FAANG stocks.

4. **Backtest Execution:**
   - For each stock, historical price data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance starting from **January 1, 2004, to January 1, 2024**.
   - The backtesting is performed using the buy/sell signals generated by the MA crossover.
   - The backtest results, including various performance metrics (total return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, etc.), are stored for each stock.

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - The script calculates the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** for the portfolio, based on the average performance across all FAANG stocks.
   - Results are printed and visualized using `vectorbt` plots.

6. **Output:**
   - The script prints the performance statistics for each stock and plots the backtest result for each ticker.
   - The final output includes the **average performance** across the entire portfolio and the calculated CAGR.

## File Details
